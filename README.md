# CS-370 Current/Emerging Trends in CS
**Overview**
  This project is a simple AI agent that navigates through a maze. The goal of the agent is to find the most ideal path while ensuring maximum rewards and minimal negative rewards.

**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

  - I was provided environment setup code with predefined libraries and tools needed as well as the rewards and negative values, I was responsible for setting up the learning model, this includes the Q-training algorithm, functions to update win history, model, agent action choice, game status and epoch state and training.

**Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:**
**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**

  - Computer scientists are the core to advancing our technology, at least in the computer and software world. These individuals are crucial to many aspects around the globe from business that rely on software and computers to operate to healthcare and government infrastructure. Modern society revolves around technology and without computer scientists these things would cause harm in our modern society. 

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

  - As a computer scientist I approach a problem in steps, I start by identifying the problem or requirements at hand, next I like to break down these problems or requirements to determine reusability, and or areas I want to troubleshoot first, I then will select appropriate tools required and or begin the process of elimination to troubleshoot the potential problems, finally I like testing and optimizing the implemented solution and or new program if needed. 

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

  - My responsibilities to the end user and the organization include ensuring security and privacy of all userâ€™s data as well as informing the user exactly what their data will be utilized for. I also need to understand that it is my responsibility to ensure programs are not released that I am aware will cause harm to society. Additionally, I need to comply with all industry standards and laws in place.
